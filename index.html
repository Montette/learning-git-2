        <h1>Anathema - Leave No Trace</h1>
        <p>Born to the glare of the senses Spoon fed reality infused A new inherent Passive contentment You are so easily amused <br> <br> Here and now We are gone in a heartbeat A dream in the Passage your time Chances are failing This world isn't waiting The moment is passing you by <br> <br>Questions lie beneath the surface The fools are fooled once again Benign coincidence We stole our existence And gladly cast it to the wind <br> <br> Here and now We are gone in a heartbeat A dream in the passage of time <br> <br> Chances are failing This world isn't waiting The moment is passing you by <br> <br> Slowly spinning on the wind back home</p>
